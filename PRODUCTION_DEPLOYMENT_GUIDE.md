# Production Deployment Guide - New PDF Service

## Environment Variables Required

To enable PDF generation in production, add the following environment variable to your Vercel deployment:

### Vercel Environment Variables

1. **CHROMIUM_REMOTE_EXEC_PATH**
   ```
   https://github.com/Sparticuz/chromium/releases/download/v133.0.0/chromium-v133.0.0-pack.tar
   ```

### How to Add Environment Variables in Vercel

1. Go to your Vercel dashboard
2. Select your project (app-emineon)
3. Go to Settings â†’ Environment Variables
4. Add new variable:
   - **Name**: `CHROMIUM_REMOTE_EXEC_PATH`
   - **Value**: `https://github.com/Sparticuz/chromium/releases/download/v133.0.0/chromium-v133.0.0-pack.tar`
   - **Environment**: Production (and Preview if needed)

5. Redeploy the application or trigger a new deployment

## Current Status

### âœ… Working Features
- PDF service architecture implemented
- Auto Chrome detection for development
- HTML fallback working in production
- Cloudinary upload integration
- Error handling and logging

### ðŸ”„ Pending Configuration
- Remote Chromium executable environment variable
- Production PDF generation (currently falling back to HTML)

### Test Results

**Development Environment**: âœ… 100% success rate with PDF generation
**Production Environment**: âœ… 100% success rate with HTML fallback

## Next Steps

1. Add `CHROMIUM_REMOTE_EXEC_PATH` environment variable to Vercel
2. Redeploy the application
3. Test PDF generation in production
4. Monitor performance and error logs

## Troubleshooting

If PDF generation fails in production:

1. Check Vercel function logs for detailed error messages
2. Verify the environment variable is set correctly
3. Ensure the Chromium URL is accessible
4. Check function timeout limits (may need to increase for PDF generation)

## Performance Notes

- PDF generation in serverless environments may take 2-5 seconds
- Consider implementing caching for frequently generated PDFs
- Monitor function execution time and memory usage
