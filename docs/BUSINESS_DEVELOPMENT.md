# Business Development Strategy

This is a practical, execution-first plan grounded in our target market, pricing, and penetration scenarios.

## ICP and Segments

- Consulting companies (management, IT, engineering) with fragmented tool stacks
- Staffing & recruitment agencies (small to mid-size)
- Executive search firms (relationship-driven, limited systems)

Region focus

- Launch: Central & Western Europe with Switzerland
- Priority expansion: DACH + France + Benelux (approx. 40,000 firms SAM)

## Positioning

- Emineon OS: the operating system for consulting workflows — profiles, delivery, client collaboration, matching, and reporting
- Swiss-engineered, privacy-first, quality-focused
- ROI: one additional placement or project engagement covers the subscription

## Packaging & Pricing (baseline)

- Starter: 1 Manager + 15 Resources — CHF 99 / month
- Growth: 2 Managers + 30 Resources — CHF 198 / month
- Professional: 3 Managers + 45 Resources — CHF 297 / month
- Enterprise: 5 Managers + 75+ Resources — CHF 495 / month

## Motions & Channels

- Founder-led sales + referrals (Year 1–2)
- Advisor network and partner introductions in DACH/Benelux
- Proof assets: demo videos, two-page capability briefs, short success notes
- Low-friction trials and fast onboarding playbooks

## Lead Targets (illustrative)

- Year 1: 200–300 qualified conversations, 50–80 trials, 20–35 paying logos
- Year 2: 400–600 conversations, 120–180 trials, 60–100 paying logos
- Year 3: 800–1200 conversations, 240–360 trials, 120–200 paying logos

Conversion assumptions (tunable)

- Lead to Trial: 25–30%
- Trial to Paid: 35–45%

## Pipeline & Activities

- Weekly: 15–25 new conversations, 5–8 demos, 3–5 trials started
- Monthly: one focused segment campaign (e.g., executive search boutiques)

## Adoption Playbook

- 2-hour guided setup: import data, configure profiles, connect email/cloud
- First value on day one: competence file generation, candidate review, client share link
- 30-day checklist for admin to specialist users; office hours for Q&A

## Retention & Expansion

- Customer success manager on commission-only basis (Year 1–2)
- Quarterly usage reviews; propose modules (matching, analytics) and extra seats
- Playbooks for multi-office and multi-brand rollouts

## Metrics & Reviews

- Core: MRR, churn, logo churn, CAC payback, time to first value, active users
- Cadence: monthly pipeline + financials; quarterly strategy and roadmap

## Milestones (aligned to roadmap)

- Year 1: PMF in two core segments; 20–35 paying customers
