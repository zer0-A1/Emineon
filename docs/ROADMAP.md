# Roadmap

This is a practical, evolving plan. Timelines are guidance. We bias to shipping value and keeping complexity low.

## Executive Summary

Purpose

- Build a focused consulting operating system with fast time‑to‑value, simple operations, and pragmatic AI.

Milestones

- Year 1: Ship end‑to‑end consulting workflows, ensure data quality and performance, production‑ready deployment.
- Year 2: Scale and automate. Deliver key integrations and matching v2. Improve onboarding and low‑touch expansion.
- Year 3: Open the ecosystem. Introduce analytics and benchmarks. Enable partner add‑ons and enterprise rollouts.

Outcomes

- Product: all candidate/client/project workflows in one OS; reliable and fast.
- Market: establish credibility in Central & Western Europe; expand across DACH, France, Benelux.
- Business: clear ROI narrative; measured growth with disciplined costs and quarterly re‑baselining.

## Target Market

### Primary Launch Region

Central & Western Europe with Switzerland as the launchpad. The region has a strong consulting and staffing ecosystem, high digital adoption, and willingness to invest in premium Swiss technology solutions.

### Priority Expansion Markets

DACH region plus France and Benelux. Combined ±40,000 staffing and consulting firms define our initial Serviceable Available Market (SAM).

### Strategic Advantages

Swiss engineering credibility and trust. Regulatory and data‑sovereignty concerns create natural moats. “Swiss‑engineered” positioning resonates with quality‑conscious European businesses.

## Customer Segments

1) Consulting Companies

Management, IT, and engineering consultancies struggling with fragmented stacks (Excel, Word, LinkedIn, legacy ATS/CRM/ERP). Need a unified operating system for candidate, client, and project workflows.

2) Staffing & Recruitment Agencies

Small/mid‑size agencies overloaded by admin work, slow placements, poor candidate experiences. Require AI‑first automation and platform unification.

3) Executive Search Firms

Relationship‑driven boutiques lacking robust digital systems; value superior client experiences and faster matching.

Market notes: heavy fragmentation (70%+ SMEs still on spreadsheets/outdated systems). Swiss premium edge and a clear ROI promise: a single additional placement or project engagement covers subscription cost.
