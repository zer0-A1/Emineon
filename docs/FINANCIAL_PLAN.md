# Financial Plan (pragmatic baseline)

This plan is built to be conservative and useful. Numbers are directional and should be revisited quarterly.

## Assumptions

- Team: small cross-functional core (2–4 FTE) + fractional design/ops
- Hosting: Vercel + managed Postgres (Neon/Supabase/RDS)
- AI usage: bounded and cacheable; pay-as-you-go
- Sales motion: founder-led with referrals; low CAC
- Pricing: SaaS with services; land small, expand with features and support

## Cost model (annual, EUR)

- Cloud (app + db + storage + observability): 8k–20k (scale-linked)
- Auth, email, misc SaaS: 3k–6k
- AI usage (prod + internal tooling): 2k–8k (depends on volume)
- Legal, accounting, ops: 4k–10k
- Team (cash comp): variable by FTE plan; baseline below

Example team baseline (2.5 FTE blended): 220k–280k

## Revenue model

- Base subscription per seat + optional modules (matching, analytics)
- Services: setup, data migration, custom workflows, training
- Target ARPA (year 1): 6–12k; (year 2): 12–24k; (year 3): 24k+

## Three-year view (orders of magnitude)

Year 1 (build + first customers)

- Costs: 260k–320k
- Revenue: 60k–120k
- Focus: product-market fit in consulting workflows, reference accounts

Year 2 (scale + integrations)

- Costs: 320k–420k
- Revenue: 250k–500k
- Focus: matching v2, integrations, reliability, low-touch onboarding

Year 3 (ecosystem + analytics)

- Costs: 420k–520k
- Revenue: 600k–1.2M
- Focus: marketplace, analytics packages, partnerships

## Cash and runway

- Maintain 12+ months runway; adjust hiring to receipts
- Keep infra variable; avoid fixed long-term contracts early

## Reporting cadence

- Monthly financial summary (MRR, churn, cash, burn)
- Quarterly roadmap/finance review and replan

## Notes

- Treat AI spend as COGS; optimize with batching and caching
- Prioritize features with measurable revenue or retention impact
- Keep the product simple; complexity is the biggest hidden cost
