enum ClientPortalRole {
  VIEWER      // Can view candidates and add comments
  COLLABORATOR // Can rate, comment, and request interviews
  ADMIN       // Can manage assessments and configure pipeline
}
```

### 4. API Implementation
```typescript
// Core API routes needed:
GET    /api/clients/[id]/portal              // Dashboard data
GET    /api/clients/[id]/portal/jobs/[jobId] // Job pipeline
POST   /api/clients/[id]/comments            // Add feedback
PUT    /api/clients/[id]/candidates/[id]/rating // Rate candidate
POST   /api/clients/[id]/interviews          // Request interview
GET    /api/clients/[id]/assessments         // Assessment requirements
```

### 5. Real-time Updates
```typescript
// WebSocket or Server-Sent Events for:
