# Emineon ATS - Fixes Summary

## ‚úÖ Fixed Issues

### 1. Job Creation
**Problem**: Job creation was failing with "Internal server error" due to strict validation and enum mismatches.

**Solution**:
- Relaxed contract type validation in schema
- Added flexible mapping for contract types (permanent ‚Üí FULL_TIME, etc.)
- Fixed field mapping between frontend (camelCase) and database (snake_case)

**Test Result**: ‚úÖ Jobs can now be created successfully

### 2. CV Upload & Parsing
**Problem**: CV parsing wasn't working - no endpoint existed for uploading and parsing CVs.

**Solution**:
- Created `/api/candidates/upload-cv` endpoint
- Integrated with CVParserService for text extraction
- Supports PDF, DOCX, TXT, HTML, and MD files
- Creates new candidates from parsed CV data
- Updates existing candidates if candidateId provided

**Test Result**: ‚úÖ CV upload creates candidates with all parsed fields

### 3. Vector Search
**Problem**: Vector search was working on backend but UI couldn't display results due to field format mismatch.

**Solution**:
- Added `transformVectorResult` helper to convert snake_case to camelCase
- Ensures all required UI fields are present (name, currentRole, etc.)
- Applied transformation to both vector and fallback text search

**Test Result**: ‚úÖ Vector search now displays results in UI
